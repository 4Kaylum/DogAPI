# DogAPI

Searching for animal picture APIs, there are plenty of them for cats, but not nearly enough for dogs, by which I mean none. There are no dog APIs that I could find. So here's one I made myself!

It's pretty simple to use. Go ahead and [click here](https://www.thedogapi.co.uk/) if you want to check it out. Contributions, pull requests, and [emails](mailto://caleb@thedogapi.co.uk) are always welcome.
